# *nemubot*

An extremely modulable IRC bot, built around XML configuration files!


## Requirements

*nemubot* requires at least Python 3.3 to work.

Some modules (like `cve`, `nextstop` or `laposte`) require the
[BeautifulSoup module](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/),
but the core and framework has no dependency.
